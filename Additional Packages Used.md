All the imported packages can be seen in the imports for the Python files. However, some of them are non-standard, 
not used in class, and not easily found/installed. Hence, we would like to credit them separately in this file.

OpenCV:

SORT:
Primarily algorithm that turned our object detection model into a motion tracking model.

FFmpeg:

Note: We used a Python wrapper for FFmpeg found here: https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python
